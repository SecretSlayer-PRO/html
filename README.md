In this repository, we are testing html programming language.
## What is HTML?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) isn’t a programming language — it’s a markup language used to structure content on web pages. It tells browsers what each part of a page is (like headings, paragraphs, links, or images). Basically, it’s the skeleton of every website, not the brain (that’s where CSS and JavaScript come in).
